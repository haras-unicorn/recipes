# Mom's cake

This is a cake recipe from my mom :). She made this a lot of times when i was a
kid and still does. It's very easy, delicious and can be customized a lot.

You can add in any fruit of your liking (canned or fresh), top it off with some
walnuts, add cinnamon, etc. A good starting amount of fruit is just enough so
you cover 50% of the area of your mixture with it. My favorite is a can of
peaches. This is just the base "at least do this" recipe.

For measuring ingredients, please use a cup of solid yogurt. You need the solid
yogurt as one of the ingredients anyway.

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 1 yogurt cup of sugar
- 1 8 g packet of vanilla sugar (optional)
- 1/2 a yogurt cup of oil
- 1 yogurt cup of semolina flour (this is called griz in Croatia)
- 1 yogurt cup of... yogurt
- 1 + 1/2 yogurt cup of flour
- 1 12 g packet of baking powder
- Fruit of your liking

## Instructions

1. Heat up oven at 180 degrees celsius
2. Mix ingredients
3. Pour mixture into a well oiled pan or on baking paper
4. Add fruit pieces of your liking and push them in the mixture
5. Bake for ~25 minutes (use toothpick to check - it should be golden brown on
   top and almost dry in the middle)
