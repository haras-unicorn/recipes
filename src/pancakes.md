Original from

with halved quantities, doubled baking powder, no vanilla sugar and simpler
instructions.

I like eating them with peanut butter and honey. You get at least 8 pancakes out
of this which for me is enough for 4 days or for sharing with friends :).

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 12 g of sugar (tablespoon)
- 300 g of all-purpose flour
- 310 ml of milk
- 60 ml of oil
- 12 g of baking powder (one of those little bags)

## Instructions

1. Mix the wet ingredients
2. Mix the dry ingredients
3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients
4. Bake on lower heat than usual to let them rise nicely :)
